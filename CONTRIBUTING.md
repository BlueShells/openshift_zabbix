Summary
=======

For any project with more than a handful of contributors, it is helpful to
agree on some guidelines for participation. This document walks through
various expectations that have developed for the OpenShift project(s).

With awareness that any open source project guidelines must sometimes bend to
allow specific circumstances, we hope these will be useful guidelines for 
making this project successful. That also means guidelines should be limited in
order to avoid becoming TL;DR.

Communication
=============

Because this repository contains monitoring checks that are often developed as
a result of operational experiences, there is an inherently iterative and
contextual nature to the code. OpenShift operations team members are happy to
help and guide you in making the best use of this respository.
